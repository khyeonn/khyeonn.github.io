Hey there! I'm Max. I'm an aspiring mechanical engineer experienced in control systems, mechatronics, and machine learning.

I earned my B.S in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2023, and will be receiving my M.S. from the same school in 2024.
During my studies, I've worked on various projects that integrate mechanical, electrical, and software systems to tackle today's engineering challenges. 

I love applying what I learned to solve complex problems, create innovative solutions, and bring ideas to life.
