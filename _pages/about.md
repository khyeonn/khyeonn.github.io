Hey there! I'm Max. I'm a mechanical engineer experienced in control systems and mechatronics.

I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2023 and 2024.
During my studies, I've worked on various projects that integrate mechanical, electrical, and software systems to tackle today's engineering challenges. 

I'm passionate about space exploration and robotics and I hope to use what I learned to help tackle humanity's next greatest frontiers.
