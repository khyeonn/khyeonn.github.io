Hey there! I'm Max Kim. I'm an aspiring mechanical engineer with a passion for innovation and problem-solving.
I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2023, and I'm currently wrapping up
my Master's degree from the same school, which I expect to receive in 2024.

I love getting my hands dirty and bringing ideas into reality. My primary interests are in control systems, robotics, and machine learning.
