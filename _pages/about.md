Hi, I’m Max. I am a mechanical engineer with experience in control systems, mechatronics, and embedded software.

I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland in 2023 and 2024. During my studies, I worked on projects that integrated mechanical, electrical, and software components to address complex, real-world engineering problems, with a strong emphasis on modeling, estimation, and system behavior.

Professionally, I work as a Control Engineer developing industrial automation and control software for live, safety-critical systems, where control correctness, deterministic behavior, and uptime are non-negotiable. This experience has reinforced disciplined development practices, rigorous testing, and system-level debugging under real operational constraints.

I apply a safety-critical systems mindset to building reliable control and embedded software for space and robotics applications.
